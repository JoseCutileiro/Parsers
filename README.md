# Parsers
Parsers I made to practice for Compiladores

## WC: Word counter

```
The hello world of flex,
a parser that count the number of words
lines and numbers of characters in one file
```

## SC++: Number of string in a c++ program

```
1. Ignore comments
2. Strigs are defined by '.*' or ".*"

New thing: Need to use STACK
```
